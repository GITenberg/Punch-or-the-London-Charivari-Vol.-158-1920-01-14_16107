<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>The Premier, says a contemporary, has become greatly attached to a
  white terrier puppy that he brought with him from Colwyn Bay. The report
  that it has been taught to run after its own tail by Mr. <font
  class="sc">Lloyd George</font> himself is probably the work of
  malice.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Our heart goes out to the tenant of an experimental wooden house who
  is advertising for the assistance of the man who successfully held up a
  post-office in London about a fortnight ago.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A London carman is said to have summoned his neighbour for calling him
  an O.B.E. We are sure he could not have meant it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"The most hygienic dress for all boys is the Scots kilt," says a
  correspondent of <i>The Daily Mail</i>. "My own boys wear nothing else."
  We are glad to see that the obsolete Highland Practice of muffling the
  ears in a cairngorm has been definitely discarded.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>According to a contemporary a new form of road surface material, which
  is not injurious to fish, has been produced by the South Metropolitan Gas
  Company. The utilisation of some of the deeper cavities in our highways
  for the purpose of food production has long been a favourite theme of
  ours.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Having a tooth drawn," says a writer in <i>Health Hints</i>, "has its
  advantages." It certainly tends to keep one's mind off the Coalition.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Two men have been charged at Sutton with selling water for whisky.
  People are now asking the exact date when this was first made an
  offence.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>At the present time a missionary costs twice as much as before the
  War, says the Rev. W.J. <font class="sc">Fullerton</font>. Many a
  cassowary has been complaining bitterly of the high cost of this
  comestible.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A new tango will be danced for the first time on January 15th, says
  <i>The Daily Express</i>. For ourselves we shall try to go about our
  business just as if nothing really serious had happened.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Asked by the magistrate if her husband had threatened her, a Stratford
  woman replied, "No; he only said he would kill me." Almost any little
  thing seems to irritate some people.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It appears that, after reading various references about his trial in
  the London papers, the ex-Kaiser was heard to say that if we were not
  very careful he would wash his hands of the whole business.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>There is a lot of wishy-washy talk about the Bolshevists, says a
  Labour paper. Wishy, perhaps, but from what we see of their pictures in
  the papers, not washy.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Supplies of string for letter mail-bags," says <i>The Post Office
  Circular</i>, "will in future be 19 inches in length, instead of 18
  inches." It is the ability to think out things like this that has made us
  the nation we are to-day.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Offers are invited in a contemporary for a large quantity of tiger
  skins. People should first make sure that the rest of the tiger has been
  properly removed before purchasing.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The composer of an American ragtime song is to have a statue erected
  to him in New York. It is hoped that this warning will have the desired
  effect on any composers in this country who may be tempted to commit a
  similar error.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We understand that, after several weeks of careful investigation into
  details, the special Committee appointed by the Government to deal with
  Germany's refusal to pay for her sunken fleet at Scapa have now
  recommended that no receipt should be given until the money is handed
  over.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"You will soon be able to get work," said the Kingston magistrate to a
  man summoned for income-tax. This is the sort of thoughtless remark that
  tends to embitter the unemployed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>According to an evening paper, Granny <font class="sc">Lambert</font>,
  of Edmonton, proposed to the reporter who visited her on her
  one-hundred-and-sixth birthday. As, however, she is experiencing some
  difficulty in obtaining the consent of her parents the affair may
  possibly fall through.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Much sympathy is felt for the scrum-half who will be unable to assist
  his team this month on account of being severely crocked whilst helping
  his wife at the Winter sales.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The London policeman who went across to Ireland for his Christmas
  holiday is still under strict observation by mental experts.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We hear that the Congo Government have now decided that all
  Brontosauri must in future carry a red front light and a green rear light
  when travelling at night-time.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The War Office is said to be making preparations to abolish the Tank
  Corps. It appears that the Major-General who recently drove from
  Whitehall to Tothill Street in one of these vehicles has reported
  unfavourably upon them, saying that he never got a wink of sleep the
  whole time.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A remarkable echo of Armageddon is reported from the Wimbledon
  district. A subscriber was rung up the other day by "Trunks" and asked if
  he still wished to say good-bye to himself before leaving for the
  Somme.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Thistles do more damage to agriculture than rats, declared the
  Montgomeryshire Agricultural Executive Committee. Stung by this
  uncalled-for attack on his national vegetable a Scotchman writes to say
  that within his knowledge more arable land has been laid waste by leeks
  than by any other noxious weed.</p>

<h2>THE DOMESTIC PROBLEM.</h2>

  <p>"Well, I've been to see three of them now," she said. "The first is at
  Shepherd's Bush&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What pipes!" I ejaculated. "What music! What wild ecstasy!"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;four hundred yards from the Central Tube, to be exact; and
  there's a large roller skating-rink next door. You never rolled, did you?
  Three sessions daily, the advertisement says."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I sat oftener than that when I rolled," I confessed.
  "'Another transport split,' as the evening papers say. I wonder whether
  Sir <font class="sc">Eric Geddes</font> is the rink-controller. But tell
  me a little about the house. I suppose there's a high premium and a deep
  basement?"</p>

  <p>"There are."</p>

  <p>"Next, please."</p>

  <p>"The next is at Chiswick; very damp and miles and miles to catch your
  bus. And there's a basement again."</p>

  <p>"You might grow mushrooms in the basement," I said hopefully, "while I
  hunted my Pimlico on the shore. What about the third?"</p>

  <p>"The third is at Hampstead, very high up and very salubrious. The
  agent says we should be able to overlook the whole of London."</p>

  <p>"Impossible," I protested; "you can't ignore a thing like London."</p>

  <p>"I don't think he meant that exactly," she explained. "He said that
  from the top bedroom window on bright days one could catch a glimpse of
  the dome of St. Paul's."</p>

  <p>"That will be rather fine," I agreed. "We can have afternoon
  receptions in the top bedroom, and print 'To meet the Dean and Chapter'
  on the card. People love meeting Chapters in real life. What is the
  rental of this eyrie?"</p>

  <p>She told me. It was as high as the site; and, again, there was a
  dug-out underneath.</p>

  <p>"You haven't tried Ponder's End?" I said at last. "I've often seen
  those words on a bus, and a lot of sad-looking people on the top,
  pondering, I suppose, the inevitable end."</p>

  <p>"Well, which of them are we going to choose? It's the servant problem
  that's the real trouble, you know. They simply won't cope with a basement
  nowadays."</p>

  <p>"I think you overestimate the help crisis," I said. "There are two
  things that they really want. The first is to have employers absolutely
  dependent on them, and the second is a gay life. To take the first. I
  remember that when I was in digs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I knit?" she asked.</p>

&mdash;"when I was in digs it was my landlady's fondest
delusion that I could do nothing to help myself. And, of
course, I was bound to foster the idea. Every night I used
to hide my pipe behind the coal-scuttle or my latchkey
in the aspidistra, just for her to find. There was rather a
terrible moment once when she came in unexpectedly and
caught me losing half-a-crown underneath the hearth-rug;
but I pretended to be finding it, and saved the situation.
It will be just the same with you. You will go down into
the basement and pretend to mistake the flour for the salt,
and the cook will love you for ever. It's all done by
kindness and incompetence."

  <p>"I suppose it is," she said doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"And then there's amusements," I went on. "We will have Charles in
  once or twice a week. No servant who has ever heard Charles trying to
  sing would prefer a night out at the cinema or the skating-rink. If she
  does, we'll get a gramophone."</p>

  <p>"Not for worlds," she gasped.</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>you</i> wouldn't have to listen to it. It would live in the
  basement, and <font class="sc">Harry Lauder</font> would help the girl to
  clean the knives and break the cups, and <font class="sc">George
  Robey</font> would make washing the dishes one grand sweet song. The
  basement would be a fairyland."</p>

  <p>"All this doesn't seem to get us much further," she complained, "in
  deciding which of those houses we're going to take."</p>

  <p>"Oh, doesn't it?" I said, and, sitting down, I wrote a few lines
  rapidly and handed her the draft for approval. She approved.</p>

  <p>And that is why, if you look at <i>The Times'</i> "Domestic
  Situations" column to-morrow, you may see the following
  announcement:&mdash;</p>

<font class="sc">House-Parlourmaid Wanted</font>, helpless couple, where
gramophone kept; state whether Hampstead, Chiswick or
Shepherd's Bush preferred.

<h2>OUR INVINCIBLE NAVY.</h2>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">Ordeal by Water</font>.</p>

  <p>When the innermost recesses of the Admiralty archives yield their
  secrets to the historian there will be some strange and stirring events
  to relate. But however diligently the chroniclers may search amongst the
  accumulated records at Whitehall there will still remain one outstanding
  performance, one shining example of courage and endurance of which no
  trace can there be found; for it was never officially known how Reginald
  McTaggart upheld the honour of the White Ensign in the Gulf of Lyons.</p>

  <p>Reginald does not in the ordinary way suffer from excess of modesty;
  indeed he has been known to hint that on more than one occasion it was
  primarily due to his efforts that the world was eventually made safe for
  democracy; but of this his greatest exploit he will never speak without
  pressure, and even then but diffidently.</p>

  <p>When <font class="sc">William Hohenzollern</font> first cried "Havoc"
  and let slip the Prussian Guard, Reginald was among the most
  unsophisticated of landsmen. He had never in his life so much as heard a
  bo'sun's pipe and could scarcely distinguish a battleship from a
  bathing-machine. But the blood of a maritime ancestry ran hot in his
  veins, and, being too highly educated to get on in the Army, he placed
  himself at the disposal of the Senior Service, which embraced him gladly.
  Henceforth his career was one of unbroken triumph.</p>

  <p>Having taken a First in Mechanical Sciences at Cambridge, Reginald was
  at once detailed off for deck-swabbing on a Portsmouth depôt ship; but
  one day an enterprising Rear-Admiral of the younger school, noting his
  scientific manner of manipulating a squeegee, had him sent before the
  Flag Captain, who, on learning his antecedents, recommended the blushing
  Reginald for the post of batman to the Senior Wireless Officer. Here his
  talents showed to such advantage that in a little over a year he received
  a commission as technical officer, and was placed in charge of an
  experimental Torpedo School, well away from the storms and tempests that
  vexed his less gifted brothers.</p>

  <p>It were tedious to relate Reginald's adventures during the next two
  years&mdash;how time and again he baffled the cunning devices of the
  German naval scientists&mdash;how he invented a pivotal billiard-table
  for use on drifters in rough weather and perfected an electro-magnetic
  contrivance by means of which enemy submarines were inveigled into
  torpedoing themselves without warning. All this and much else is
  accessible to the formal historian; besides, Reginald tells people
  himself. We will hurry on to the grand exploit.</p>

  <p>It occurred shortly after he was appointed to a post on the British
  Naval Mission at Athens. He had left England little more than a month
  when the Sea Lords became uneasy. Trouble broke out among the torpedoes
  and there was no one to set matters right. Paragraphs began to appear in
  the Press. The result was an urgent wireless message to Athens recalling
  Reginald at once. There was to be no delay.</p>

  <p>"Are you prepared to start immediately?" asked the Vice-Admiral, when
  he had briefly outlined the situation.</p>

  <p>Reginald saluted briskly.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite know how you'll go," continued the Vice-Admiral. "We
  haven't an armed ship sailing West for a week. There's a little Greek
  trading steamer leaving for Marseilles to-morrow morning, but I'm afraid
  you would find her very incommodious. Would you care to risk it?" <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span></p>

  <p>"I start in the morning, Sir," said Reginald tersely.</p>

  <p>The Vice-Admiral seized his hand and wrung it warmly.</p>

  <p>When Reginald came down to the harbour and saw the craft on which he
  had undertaken to embark he was seized with a sudden faintness. Even the
  toughest seafarer would have thought twice before venturing beyond the
  breakwater in such an unsavoury derelict; and Reginald, be it remembered,
  had only once in his life made a sea voyage, and that in the peaceful
  security of an ironclad. His heart quailed beneath his Commander's
  uniform.</p>

  <p>However, setting his teeth and consoling himself with the thought that
  she would undoubtedly fall to pieces before they could leave the harbour
  behind, he went aboard.</p>

  <p>The master, an unprepossessing but exceedingly polite child of the
  Ægean, was overwhelmed at the prospect of carrying a British Naval
  Commander as passenger. He saluted wildly; he gesticulated; it was too
  much honour. Would his Excellency the Commander accept the use of his
  poor state-room&mdash;yes? Would he undertake the navigation of this so
  dangerous voyage&mdash;no? Ah, but he would seek his so expert advice in
  the sudden perilous moment&mdash;good. Reginald bowed nervously.</p>

  <p>At first all went well. Except for the atmosphere of the state-room,
  which was richly tinged with a mixed odour of mildewed figs and rotten
  pomegranates, and the uncomfortable feeling that, unless he trod
  delicately, the decks would crumble away and deposit him in the bosom of
  the Mediterranean, Reginald was fairly happy. A ready wit and a dignified
  bearing combined to cloak his lack of seamanship and kept the skipper in
  a fit state of humility and awe.</p>

  <p>But in the Gulf of Lyons a breeze sprang up. It was quite a gentle
  breeze at first, and Reginald found it rather stimulating. Towards
  evening, however, it freshened, and the ship began to stagger. Reginald
  became conscious of those disquieting symptoms common to landsmen in such
  case. Fearful for his reputation he crept below to suffer in
  solitude.</p>

  <p>By midnight it was blowing a gale, and Reginald had lost interest in
  life. He was thinking mournfully of the vanity of all human desires when
  a message was brought from the captain. They were about to perish. Would
  his Excellency the Commander come up to the bridge and save them,
  please?</p>

  <p>It was a painful predicament, and Reginald was justly horrified. Could
  he venture out and display the weakness of the British Navy in the face
  of a crew of unwashed Greek matelots? On the other hand, could he skulk
  in his cabin and allow the Master to doubt his courage and resource? He
  rose and lurched unsteadily on deck.</p>

  <p>The Captain was distinctly excited. Destruction was imminent. He had
  appealed to the Saints without avail. Would the British Commander come to
  their assistance? What did his Excellency think of it?</p>

  <p>Reginald thought it was perfectly horrible. He had never thought such
  a ghastly scene possible. The ship appeared on the point of turning
  turtle and he was soaked to the skin already. Then, realizing that he
  could not remain on the bridge another minute without internal disaster,
  he made a supreme effort.</p>

  <p>"My dear skipper," he howled at the top of his voice, "you surely
  don't call this a storm? The merest breeze, I assure you. I really can't
  be disturbed for such a trifle. If it begins to blow at all during the
  night let me know and I'll come up and take the matter in hand;" and
  without waiting for a reply he scrambled down from the bridge and made a
  dash for the seclusion of the state-room.</p>

  <p>Next morning they were rolling in the swell off Marseilles, with the
  prestige of the British Navy, if possible, higher than ever.</p>

<h2>A PAINFUL SUBJECT.</h2>

  <p>I do not love dentists. In this antipathy I am not unique, I fancy.
  One never sees photographs of family dentists standing on mantelpieces
  heavily framed in silver; and, though <i>The Forceps</i> presents a
  coloured supplement depicting a prominent ivory-hunter with every
  Christmas number, there is, I am told, no violent demand for it outside
  the Profession.</p>

  <p>This is not to be wondered at. A man who spends his life climbing into
  people's mouths and playing "The Anvil Chorus" on their molars with a
  monkey-wrench, who says, "Now this won't hurt you in the least," and then
  deals one a smart rap on a nerve with a pickaxe&mdash;such a man cannot
  expect to be popular. He must console himself with his fees.</p>

  <p>I do not love dentists, I repeat, but I am also not infatuated with
  toothache. It is not that I am a coward. Far from it. Arterial sclerosis,
  glycosuria, follicular tonsillitis and, above all, sleeping sickness I
  can bear with fortitude&mdash;that is, I feel sure I could&mdash;but
  toothache, no! I am not ashamed of it. Every brave man has at least one
  weakness. Lord <font class="sc">Roberts's</font> was cats. Achilles' was
  tendons. Mine is toothache (Biographers, please note). When my jaw annoys
  me I try to propitiate it with libations of whisky, brandy, iodine,
  horse-blister and patent panaceas I buy from sombreroed magicians in the
  Strand. If these fail I totter round to the dentist, ring the bell and
  run away. If the maid catches me before I can escape and turns me into
  the waiting-room I examine the stuffed birds and photographs of Brighton
  Pier until she has departed, then slither quietly down the banisters,
  open the street door and gallop. If I am pushed directly into the
  <i>abattoir</i> I shake the dentist warmly by the hand, ask after his
  wife and children, his grandfather and great-aunt, and tell him I have
  only dropped in to tune the piano. If that is no good I try to make an
  appointment for an afternoon this year, next year, some time, never. If
  that too is useless and he insists on putting me through it there and
  then, I take every anodyne he's got&mdash;cocaine, morphia, chloroform,
  ether, gas, also a couple of anæsthetists to hold my hand when I go off
  and kiss me when I come round again.</p>

  <p>One of my chief objections to dentists is that they will never listen
  to reason; explanations are quite thrown away on them. They only let you
  talk at all in order to get your face open, and then into it they plunge
  their powerful antiseptic-tasting hands and you lose something. I never
  go near a dentist without paying the extreme penalty. (None of those
  cunning little gold-tipped caps or reinforced concrete suspension-bridges
  for me. Out it comes. Blood and iron every time). I admit they frequently
  appease my anguish. Almost invariably among the teeth of which they
  relieve me at each sitting is included the offending one. But still I
  maintain my right to have a say in my own afflictions. The doctors let
  one. I've got a physician who lets me have any disease I fancy (except
  German measles and Asiatic cholera; for patriotic reasons he won't hear a
  good word spoken for either of them; says we've got just as good diseases
  of our own. Damned insularity!).</p>

  <p>If I send for this doctor he comes along, sits quietly beside my bed,
  eating my grapes, while I tell him where the pain isn't. The recital over
  he hands me a selection of ailments to pick from. I choose one. He tells
  me what the symptoms are, drinks my invalid port, creeps downstairs and
  breaks the news to the hushed and awe-stricken family. A chap like that
  makes suffering a pleasure and is a great comfort in a home like mine,
  where a sick bed is the only sort you are allowed to lie in after 10
  <font class="sc">a.m.</font> Without the fellow's ready sympathy I doubt
  if I should secure any sleep at all. One gets no assistance of that kind
  from dentists, although they give you more pain in ten seconds than a
  doctor does in ten years.</p>

  <p>No dentist ever sees me home after the slaughter, orders me a diet of
  chicken breast, <i>pêche Melba</i> and champagne, or warns my family that
  I am on no account to be disturbed until lunch. No, they jerk your jaw
  off its hinges and dump your remains on the doorstep for the L.C.C.
  rubbish cart to collect.</p>

  <p>Another thing: dentists should not be allowed out loose about the
  streets. They exercise a blighting influence. You are strolling along in
  the sunshine, head high, chest expanded, telling some wide-eyed young
  thing what you and <font class="sc">Haig</font> did to <font
  class="sc">Ludendorff</font>, when suddenly you meet the dentist. You
  look at him, he looks at you, and his eyes seem to say, "What ho, my
  hero! Last week you went to ground under my sofa and couldn't be
  dislodged until I put the page-boy in to ferret you."</p>

  <p>"And what happened then," inquires the wide-eyed young thing, "after
  you had caught the Hun tank by the tail and ripped it up with a
  tin-opener?"</p>

  <p>"After that," says the eye of the dentist, "you wept, you prayed, you
  lay on the floor and kicked, you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And did you kill all the crew yourself?" bleats the maiden,
  "single-handed&mdash;every one of them?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I&mdash;er," you stutter&mdash;"what I mean to say&mdash;that
  is&mdash;Oh, dash it, let's go and get tea somewhere, what?"</p>

<h3>MY FIRE.</h3>

  <p>"Seventy-five per cent. of the world's accidents arise from gross
  carelessness!" I thundered at Suzanne, who for the fifteenth time in five
  years of matrimony had left her umbrella in the 'bus. Being on a month's
  leave, and afraid of losing by neglect the orderly-room touch, I thought
  fit to practise on her the arts of admonition. Admonishing, I wagged at
  her the match with which I was in the act of lighting my pipe. Wagging
  the match, I did not notice the live head drop off on to the khaki slacks
  which I had donned that afternoon to grace a visit to the War Office.
  Only when I traced Suzanne's petrified stare to its target did I discover
  that a ventilation hole had been created in a vital part of His Majesty's
  uniform.</p>

  <p>With great presence of mind I put out the conflagration before
  venturing on an encounter with Suzanne's eye.</p>

  <p>"You were discussing accidents," she observed sweetly. "What
  percentage of them did you say was due to gross carelessness?"</p>

  <p>I did not bandy words. There was no escaping the fact that they were,
  as Suzanne reminded me, my sole surviving pair of khaki slacks, and that
  I should certainly have to get a new pair before returning to the Depôt;
  for these were obviously beyond wear or repair.</p>

  <p>"Well, anyhow I've three weeks to get them in," I said as lightly as I
  could. "My leave isn't up till the end of the month."</p>

  <p>"Men's clothes are terribly dear just now," remarked Suzanne
  pensively. "And I <i>was</i> going to ask you to give me a new hat. But
  now I suppose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>This roused my pride and self-respect.</p>

  <p>"Suzanne," I said, "the world is not coming to an end because I have
  to buy a pair of slacks. You shall have your new hat to-morrow."</p>

  <p>She clapped her hands in triumph, and a moment's reflection showed me
  that I had been caught. If it hadn't been for the conflagration she would
  never have dared to ask for a new hat. Now I came to remember, I had
  taken her out and bought her one on the first day of my leave.</p>

  <p>However, the damage was done (twice over, in fact), and I sat gently
  brooding over it in silence. Suddenly an inspiring thought struck me.
  Eagerly I made my way to the writing-table and drew out a long and bulky
  envelope from the bottom drawer. For some time I sat there carefully
  mastering its contents.</p>

  <p>"What's that funny-looking thing you're reading?" asked my wife at
  last.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing important," I answered as casually as I could.
  "Er&mdash;by the way, do you know we're insured?"</p>

  <p>"Considering that I've paid the premiums regularly while you were
  away, I should think I ought to know."</p>

  <p>"Of course I shall put in a claim for the slacks," I murmured.</p>

  <p>"But how can you?" she asked, and wondering looked at me. "I read the
  policy once, and as far as I remember there's nothing whatever about
  khaki slacks in it."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what this policy is?" I exclaimed, brandishing the
  document impressively. "It's a Comprehensive Householder's policy. I
  don't know what a Comprehensive Householder is, but I think I must be
  one."</p>

  <p>"But I'm <i>sure</i> it says nothing about slacks," she objected.</p>

  <p>"Comprehensive!" I shouted. "That means all-embracing. This policy
  embraces my slacks."</p>

  <p>"That sounds almost indelicate."</p>

  <p>"Listen. 'Whereas the undermentioned, hereinafter called the
  Accused&mdash;the Assured, I mean&mdash;has paid blank pounds, shillings
  and pence Premium or Consideration ... to insure him/her from loss or
  damage by Lightning, Explosion, Earthquake, Thunderbolts ...'"</p>

  <p>"Oo-er," said Suzanne with a shiver.</p>

  <p>"'... Aeroplanes, Airships, and/or other Aerial Craft, Storm, Tempest,
  Subterranean Fire ...'"</p>

  <p>"Monsoon, Typhoon, Volcano, Avalanche," put in Suzanne impatiently.
  "Cut the cataclysms and come to the slacks."</p>

  <p>"I'm just coming to them. '... Burglary, Housebreaking, Theft and/or
  Larceny'&mdash;now hold your breath, for we're getting
  there&mdash;'Conflagration and/or Fire....'" I paused to let it sink in.
  "The fact is," I continued weightily, "we've had a Fire."</p>

  <p>"Have we? But I wasn't dressed for it. I should have worn a mauve
  <i>peignoir</i>, and been carried down to safety by a blond fireman. To
  have a fire without a fire-engine is like being married at a
  registry-office. Next time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, we've had a Fire, within the meaning of the policy. Now
  I'm going to write a letter to the Insurance Company."</p>

  <p>And I did so to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"77, <i>The Supermansions</i>,</p>
      <p><i>S.W.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"<font class="sc">Dear Sirs</font>,&mdash;I regret to inform you that
  a fire took place at/in the above demesne and/or flat after tea to-day
  and damaged one (1) pair of khaki slacks/trousers so as to render them
  unfit for further use. I shall therefore be glad to receive from you the
  sum of two guineas, the original cost price of the damaged article of
  apparel.</p>

  <p>"Yours, etc."</p>

  <p>Next day I took Suzanne out to buy the new hat. This done, we went on
  to my tailor's to replace the ill-starred slacks. A casual inquiry as to
  price elicited the statement that it would be four guineas. I cut short a
  rambling discourse, in which the tailor sought to saddle various remote
  agencies with the responsibility for the increase, and stamped out of the
  establishment with the blasphemous vow that I'd get a pair ready-made at
  the Stores.</p>

  <p>That evening I received a reply from the Insurance people:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"In all communications please quote Ref. No. 73856/SP/QR.</p>

  <p>"<font class="sc">Sir</font>,&mdash;We note your claim for garments
  injured by an outbreak of fire at your residence. We await the reports of
  the Fire Brigade and Salvage Corps, on receipt of which we will again
  communicate with you. Meanwhile, will you kindly inform us what other
  damage was done?</p>

  <p>"We are, yours, etc." <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"
  id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span></p>

  <p>I at once wrote back to remove their misapprehension:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"<font class="sc">Dear Sirs</font>,&mdash;My fire was not what you
  would call an outbreak. It was essentially a quiet affair, attended by
  neither Fire Brigade nor Salvage Corps, but just the family (like being
  married at a registry-office, don't you think?). My khaki slacks were the
  only articles injured. As I am now going about without them, you will
  realise that no time should be lost in settling the claim.</p>

  <p>"Yours, etc.</p>

  <p>"P.S. I nearly forgot&mdash;73856/RS/VP. There!"</p>

  <p>A day or two later I received a request, pitched in an almost
  slanderously sceptical tone, for more detailed information. I humoured
  them, and there ensued a ding-dong correspondence, in which that wretched
  Ref. No. was bandied backwards and forwards with nauseating reiteration,
  and of which the following are the salient points:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>They.</i> Kindly state what you estimate the total value of the
  contents of your residence to be.</p>

  <p><i>Myself</i> (<i>after a searching inquiry into present prices</i>).
  £1,500.</p>

  <p><i>They</i> (<i>promptly</i>). We beg to point out that you are only
  insured for a total sum of £750. In accordance with the terms of your
  policy you are only entitled to recover such proportion of the value of
  the loss or damage as the total insured bears towards the total value of
  the contents&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, one-half.</p>

  <p><i>Myself.</i> Two guineas is exactly one-half of four guineas, the
  present cost of slacks. Please see attached affidavit from tailor. (By a
  masterly stroke I had actually induced the rascal to set out his iniquity
  in black and white.)</p>

  <p>At last, twenty days after the fire, when I had finally screwed myself
  up to the point of going out to buy a pair of reach-me-downs, I was
  rewarded by receiving a cheque for two guineas from the Insurance
  Company, "in full settlement."</p>

  <p>By the same post I received a letter from the Adjutant of my Depôt
  informing me that I was not to return at the expiration of my leave, but
  by War Office instructions (I will spare you the Ref. No.) was to proceed
  instead to the Crystal Palace for immediate demobilization. (That, by the
  way, is part of the game of being a volunteer for the Army of
  Occupation.) It was Suzanne who brought the two letters into their proper
  correlation.</p>

  <p>"You won't have to get a new pair of slacks now," she said.</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul, no!" I exclaimed. "Then what ought I to do with this
  cheque? Send it back?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," cried Suzanne as she snatched it from my wavering
  hand. "I've been wanting a new hat for some time."</p>

<h3>MY SALES DAY.</h3>

  <p>7.0 to 8.30. Rise, breakfast, and make out shopping-list. I put
  down:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Waterproof for Henry.</p>
      <p>School-frock and boots for the Kid.</p>
      <p>Replenish household linen.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>9.0. Arrive at large emporium just as the doors open. Ask to be
  directed to gentleman's mackintoshes. Pause on the way to look at evening
  wraps marked down from five guineas to 98/11. It seems a sweeping
  reduction, but I do not require an evening wrap.</p>

  <p>9.10 to 10.15. Try on evening wraps. Select a perfectly sweet <i>Rose
  du Barri</i> duvetyn lined <i>gris foncé</i>.</p>

  <p>10.15. Continuing to head for mackintoshes. The course runs past a
  job-line in silk hosiery. Remember I ought to get stockings to go with
  the evening wrap.</p>

  <p>10.15 to 11.5. Match stockings.</p>

  <p>11.15. Arrive at gentlemen's mackintoshes. Find they are not being
  reduced in the sale. Observe however that some handsome silk shirts with
  broad stripes are marked half-price; get three for Henry, also a fancy
  waistcoat at 6/11¾ (was 25/-), only slightly soiled down front.</p>

  <p>11.40. Ask for Children's Department. Take wrong turning and arrive at
  millinery.</p>

  <p>11.40 to 1.10. Try on hats. Decide on a ducky little toque and a
  fascinating river hat (for next summer).</p>

  <p>1.10 to 1.30. Still asking for Children's Department. When it is
  finally given to me I am told that useful school-frocks have all been
  sold.</p>

  <p>1.30 to 6.30. Drift to Shoe Department; secure a pair of pink satin
  slippers&mdash;rather tight, but amazingly cheap. Swept by crowd into
  "Fancy Goods"; make several purchases. Get taken in a crush to "Evening
  Accessories"; am persuaded to buy.</p>

  <p>6.35. Leave emporium. It is raining heavily.</p>

  <p>7.15. Arrive home wet and exhausted. Have an argument, conducted
  affably on my side, with Henry, who flatly refuses to wear the half-price
  striped shirts or pay for the only-slightly-soiled waistcoat. He makes
  pointed remarks about the bad weather, with cynical reference to
  mackintoshes. Am struck afresh by the selfishness of men.</p>

  <p>7.45. Remember that I have forgotten household linen and Kid's boots,
  but determine not to let this spoil my good temper.</p>

  <p>8.0. Dine alone with Henry. Do my best to show a forgiving spirit in
  face of his egoism. So to bed, conscious of a day well spent.</p>

<h2>THE EGOIST.</h2>

  <p>On Monday morning Hereward Vale left home in an unsettled state of
  mind. That was putting it mildly. He was thoroughly unhappy. Something
  was up&mdash;he couldn't tell what&mdash;or whether it was his own fault
  or Mary's. Anyhow, it didn't seem to matter whose fault it was. The thing
  had happened. That was the one overwhelming idea that concerned him. The
  first shadow had fallen; their record of complete and perfect happiness
  was broken.</p>

  <p>The road to the station was a long and particularly beautiful one.
  Hereward had always appreciated every inch of it. But to-day he hated it.
  He hated the way the yew-trees drooped, the leafless branches of the
  hazels, the faded, crumpled blackberry, the scattered decaying leaves. It
  was really a remarkable day for November&mdash;clear and frosty, with a
  bright blue sky and scudding white clouds. A strong north-east wind
  tested one's vitality. Hereward's was low. He buttoned his collar and
  hurried on.</p>

  <p>Mary had never treated him quite like this before. She had always been
  tender, sympathetic and understanding with his moods. True, he was
  trying; but she had known that before she married him. He was an artist,
  and an artist's work, he argued, depended largely on the state of his
  emotions. He earned the family bread by the labour of his hands and his
  hand was the servant of his mind, and his mind a tempest of moods. Mary
  had applied herself to her task with creditable skill. She could always
  turn his sullenness to a sort of creative melancholy of which he was
  rather proud; his restlessness to energy and his discontent to something
  like constructive thinking. How she achieved the miracle he did not know,
  nor did he inquire. But he was guided by her as a child by its mother,
  still constantly rebelling.</p>

  <p>But to-day the machinery had broken down. Mary had been cool, pleasant
  and crisply unemotional at breakfast-time. He had woken up cross and with
  a headache. He had a muddled feeling and wanted sorting out. But Mary
  seemed quite unaware of it. She had a preoccupied manner; she went about
  just too cheerfully, chatting just too pleasantly about trivial things.
  It was mechanical, Hereward decided, and, anyway, it wasn't at all what
  he wanted. His monosyllabic responses were accepted as perfectly right
  and natural, when they were nothing of the sort. She did not get up and
  pass her hand lovingly and soothingly over his hair and say things
  appropriate to his state of mind. She went on with her breakfast and
  looked after him kindly enough, but without solicitude.</p>

  <p>For instance, she made no comment on the fact that he had hardly
  touched his bacon; she merely removed his plate and gave him marmalade
  and toast as if he had left no bacon at all. She didn't even notice the
  lines of suffering on his face, the dark circles under his eyes. He cast
  a glance in the mirror when her back was turned to see if they were
  obvious. They were. Why wasn't Mary catching his hump? She always
  did.</p>

  <p>When finally he left the house, a little bent, with no spring in his
  step, Mary didn't accompany him to the door. She didn't exchange with him
  one of those rapid looks of complete understanding that he had grown so
  accustomed to and found so sustaining <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span> and helpful. She kissed him
  firmly and coolly, almost casually. Just so she might kiss an aunt.</p>

  <p>The train journey was cold and lonely. Nobody he knew was travelling
  up to town. He bought a daily paper, but the headlines put him off. They
  were nearly all about divorce cases. There was one about a man who had
  lived for three years in the same house with his wife without speaking to
  her. Such things were possible! He gazed out of the window. The wonderful
  day had no charm for him. The feeling of autumn only further increased
  his sense of the loss of youth, of the decay of romance. He nursed and
  nourished his grievance. He desired that Mary should know what a wreck
  she had made of his day, possibly of his life.</p>

  <p>He was in no mood for work. He went up to his studio in Fitzroy Square
  and muddled about with pens and ink. He had what he called a good tidy
  up, and firmly and consistently threw away every relic of sentiment he
  had foolishly preserved. At one o'clock, through habit and not because he
  was hungry, he went out and had a lonely lunch at a small restaurant,
  sitting at a marble-topped table which imparted to him something of its
  chill. After that he loafed about looking at things till dusk. Dusk was
  quite unbearable. He fled back to the studio, made up a stupendous fire,
  lit a pipe and mused.</p>

  <p>He decided not to go home that night. He felt hurt and ill-used. He
  would stay in town and have a thoroughly good time. As the idea struck
  him he looked round the studio. The corners were dismal and shadowy.
  Everything not in the immediate circle of the fire looked grey and
  cheerless. His easel, with a bit of drapery thrown across it, was like a
  spectre with outstretched arms. It suggested despair. He could think of
  no one whom he wanted to see. There wasn't a soul he knew whom he would
  not in this crisis deliberately have avoided.</p>

  <p>So he went to the Russian Ballet and was bored. He had been excited
  about <i>Cleopatra</i> the first time he had seen it; he now decided that
  it was a great mistake to try to repeat emotional experiences.</p>

  <p>He left hurriedly before the programme was half over. His feet took
  him mechanically to Waterloo Station. He looked up a train. The 9.30 was
  due out; he sprinted and caught it. The carriage he managed to get into
  was empty and warm. He slept; he slept all the way, and it did him
  good.</p>

  <p>When he arrived at the other end the night was calm and the sky
  star-spangled. The walk out exhilarated him; his exasperation was over.
  He ran lightly down the leaf-strewn steps of the old garden and looked in
  at the window. Mary was seated at the fire. She looked pensive, pretty
  and a little sad. He whistled and she smiled up. "Hooray!" she said, "I'd
  nearly given you up." She slipped round and had the door open before he
  could get out his key and drew him in. She helped him off with his coat
  and scanned his face with even more than her usual intentness and
  interest. But she didn't ask him why he was late and he didn't tell her.
  He thought that could wait.</p>

  <p>Their extemporised supper was a great success, and they sat before the
  wood fire far into the night.</p>

  <p>"What was up this morning?" he finally asked. "You weren't quite
  yourself, were you?"</p>

  <p>"This morning?" she questioned, puzzled. "Oh, I remember. I woke with
  a splitting headache. Did you notice it? You nice old thing!"</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">"Mr. Pim Passes By."</font></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"The year's at the spring</p>
      <p>And day's at the morn...</p>
      <p>God's in His heaven&mdash;</p>
      <p>All's right with the world!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>When <i>Pippa</i> "passed," singing songs like that and preoccupied
  with the splendid fact of her one day's holiday, she unconsciously
  brought about a change for the better in the heart or conscience of all
  who overheard her. It was not so with the passing of <i>Mr. Pim</i>.
  Prior to his intrusion, there had been nothing to disturb the
  well-ordered existence of <i>Geo. Marden, Esq., J.P.,</i> and his wife
  (late Mrs. Tellworthy), except that they did not see eye to eye on the
  small question of his niece's early engagement to a young artist and on
  the still smaller question of futuristic curtains. Then came <i>Mr.
  Garraway Pim</i>, a doddering old gentleman, with a thin falsetto voice
  and a loosish memory, but otherwise harmless. He arrives with an
  introduction from Australia and casually lets fall a tale of a
  fellow-passenger with the unusual name of Tellworthy, from
  which&mdash;and other incidental evidence&mdash;<i>Mrs. Marden</i>
  gathers that her first husband (an ex-convict) is still alive. Having
  dropped this thunderbolt he drifts off, leaving tragedy in his wake. End
  of Act I.</p>

  <p><i>Marden</i>, highly conscientious, takes the orthodox view that his
  lawless marriage must be nullified. His wife, though horrified at the
  resurrection of her impossible first husband, permits herself to
  recognise the humorously ironic side of things. <i>Mr. Pim</i>,
  fortunately located in the immediate neighbourhood, is sent for that he
  may throw further light on the painful subject of Tellworthy's revival.
  He now reports&mdash;what he had vaguely imagined himself to have
  mentioned in the first instance&mdash;that Tellworthy had met his death
  at Marseilles through swallowing a herring-bone. The Second Act closes
  with a burst of jubilant hysterics on the part of <i>Mrs. Marden</i>.</p>

  <p>But the situation is only partially relieved. True, the old husband is
  dead all right, but the <i>Mardens'</i> marriage is still bigamous; they
  have been living all this time in what would be regarded in the eyes of
  Heaven (and, still worse, the county of Bucks) as sin. However, a
  trifling formality at a registry-office can rectify this and nobody need
  be any the wiser. This at least is <i>Marden's</i> attitude, always free
  from any suspicion of complexity. But his wife (if that is the word for
  her), being of a more subtle nature, determines to make profit out of the
  situation. She points out to him that she is at present the widow
  Tellworthy and that she must be wooed all over again, and can only be won
  on her own terms. These include a recognition of the niece's engagement
  (has not the young artist an equal right with <i>Marden</i> to a speedy
  marriage with the woman of his choice?) and a concession to her taste in
  futuristic curtains.</p>

    A DROPPER OF UNCONSIDERED TRIFLES.

    <div class="i16">
	<p><i>Mr. Pim.</i> Mr. <font class="sc">Dion Boucicault</font>.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs Marden.</i> Miss <font class="sc">Irene Vanbrugh</font>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>At this juncture <i>Mr. Pim</i> drifts in again to correct an error of
  memory. The name of the gentleman who succumbed to the herring-bone was
  not Tellworthy (he must have got that name into his head through hearing
  it mentioned as that of <i>Mrs. Marden's</i> first husband). It was
  really Polwhistle&mdash;either Henry or Ernest Polwhistle; he was not
  quite sure which. Everything is thus restored to the <i>status quo
  ante</i>, except that <i>Marden</i>, in a spasm of generous reaction,
  feels himself morally bound to abide by the new conditions that his wife
  had laid down.</p>

  <p><i>Mr. Pim</i> only passes by once more to announce his settled
  conviction that <i>Polwhistle's</i> Christian name was Ernest and not
  Henry.</p>

  <p>It will be seen that the play is original in design; but it is also a
  true play of character revealed by circumstance. Further&mdash;and this
  is very rare&mdash;it owes nothing to the adventitious aid of the
  costumier. For the author's observation of the unities is extended to
  include the matter of dress; he allows his people one costume each and no
  more.</p>

  <p>Miss <font class="sc">Irene Vanbrugh</font> played as if every one of
  her words had been made expressly for her, as, no doubt, they were. I
  have never seen her so perfect in detail, in the poise of her head, in
  her least gesture and intonation, in her swift changes of mood; never so
  quietly mistress of the <i>finesse</i> of her art.</p>

  <p>As <i>Marden</i>, Mr. <font class="sc">Ben Webster</font> was a little
  restless in a part for which he was not constitutionally suited, but
  played with the greatest courage and sincerity. Mr. <font class="sc">Dion
  Boucicault's</font> study of <i>Mr. Pim</i> was extraordinarily
  effective; and the way in which he made the attenuated pipings of this
  futile old gentleman carry like the notes of a bell was in itself a
  remarkable feat.</p>

  <p>These three were given great chances, full of colour. But in the part
  of <i>Brian Strange</i>, the boy-lover, by its nature relatively
  colourless, Mr. <font class="sc">Leslie Howard</font> was hardly less
  good. He never made anything like a mistake of manner. I wish I could say
  the same of his flapper. But Miss <font class="sc">Cohan</font> asserted
  her good spirits a little too boisterously for the picture.</p>

  <p>I hope I shall not be suspected of partiality towards one of Mr.
  Punch's young men if I say that this is the best of the good things that
  Mr. <font class="sc">Milne</font> has given us. As in his unacted play,
  <i>The Lucky One</i>, he gives evidence of a desire, not unfrequent in
  humourists, to be taken seriously. But he knows by now that brilliant
  dialogue is what is expected of him, and he thinks, too modestly, that he
  cannot afford to dispense with it for long at a time. The result is that,
  after stringing us up to face a tragic situation, he is tempted to let us
  down with light-hearted cynicisms. He would hate me to suggest that Mr.
  <font class="sc">Bernard Shaw</font> has infected him, but perhaps he
  wouldn't mind my hinting at the influence of Sir <font class="sc">James
  Barrie</font>. Certainly his <i>Mardens</i> remind me of the
  <i>Darlings</i> in <i>Peter Pan</i>. Just as there we were invited
  alternately to weep for the bereaved mother's sorrow and roar over the
  bereaved father's buffooneries, so here, though not so disastrously, our
  hearts are torn between sympathy for the husband's real troubles and
  amusement at the wife's flippant attitude towards the common tragedy.</p>

  <p>I will not deny the sneaking pleasure which this flippancy gave me at
  the time, but in the light of calmer reflection I feel that Mr. <font
  class="sc">Milne</font> would really have pleased himself better if he
  could have found the courage to keep the play on a serious note all
  through the interval between <i>Mr. Pim's</i> first and second
  revelations. Apart from the higher question of sincerity he would have
  gained something, in an artistic sense, by getting a stronger contrast
  out of the change of situation that followed the announcement of
  Tellworthy's demise.</p>

  <p>In the First Act we seemed to have a little too much of the young
  couple, but this insistence was perhaps justified by the important part
  which their affairs subsequently played (along with the <i>leit-motif</i>
  of the futuristic curtains) in the readjustment of the relations between
  husband and wife.</p>

  <p>If I have any flaw to find in a really charming play, I think it was a
  mistake for <i>Mrs. Marden</i> to let <i>Mr. Pim</i> into the secret of
  her past. As with the sweet influences of <i>Pippa</i>, so with the
  devastating havoc wrought by the inexactitudes of <i>Mr. Pim</i>, I think
  he should have been left unconscious of the effect of his passing.</p>

<h3>ANOTHER CRISIS.</h3>

  <p>Whether it is due to war-weariness or not the fact remains that the
  British public view with apparent apathy the new crises which arise day
  by day to threaten their happiness and maybe to change the whole course
  of their life.</p>

  <p>Only a few mornings ago we read in <i>The Daily Chronicle</i> the
  following momentous statement made by that newspaper's golf
  correspondent: "I'm told that the thirty-one pennyweight ball is doomed."
  Doomed! Yet, so far as could be observed in the demeanour of the
  pleasure-seekers in the Strand on the afternoon of that same day, things
  might have been exactly as they were the day before.</p>

  <p>We learn that the sub-committee investigating this matter of the
  thirty-one pennyweight ball have consulted both the manufacturers and the
  professionals. A ray of hope is given by the statement, made on good
  authority, that "the manufacturers have adopted a very reasonable
  attitude." The country should be grateful for this. But, on the other
  hand, "the professionals want full freedom in the selection of
  balls."</p>

  <p>To foster a false optimism at this juncture would be criminal, and it
  may as well be admitted at once that negotiations are proceeding with
  difficulty. As we go to press we learn that a protracted meeting, lasting
  from 2 <font class="sc">p.m.</font> until after midnight, has been held.
  The leader of the manufacturers, on emerging from the conference hall,
  was seen to look pale and exhausted. Pushing his way through the pressmen
  and photographers he said, "Boys, for the moment we are bunkered; we must
  employ the niblick. No, that is all I can tell you;" and he walked
  quickly away with his hand to his brow and muttering words seldom heard
  off the course.</p>

  <p>Equally grave, the organising secretary of the professionals was even
  less communicative, for he spoke in his native tongue, and the Scotsman
  among the reporters who undertook to translate his remarks was
  unfortunately unable to make himself understood.</p>

  <p>The <font class="sc">Prime Minister's</font> Private Secretary has
  issued to the Press a statement that Mr. <font class="sc">Lloyd
  George</font> is keeping in close touch with Walton Heath and the
  progress of events, but that at present no useful purpose would be served
  by Government interference.</p>

  <p><i>The Daily Chronicle</i> correspondent also announces that
  representatives of American golf are to visit St. Andrews in the Spring
  to discuss the question. We trust their visit may not be too late. If the
  problem is one that can be solved by dollars no doubt they will come
  well-equipped for enforcing American opinion on the British public. We
  can only hope that international relationships will not be strained by
  their deliberations; let there be a spirit of toleration and a
  recognition of the rights of small nations, and all may yet be well.</p>

<h3>WHY THE SPARROW LIVES
IN THE TOWN.</h3>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>In noisy towns, where traffic roars and rushes</p>
      <p class="i2">And where the grimy streets are dark and narrow,</p>
      <p>You never see the robins and the thrushes,</p>
      <p class="i2">Nor hear their songs. Only the City sparrow</p>
      <p>Chirps bravely and as cheerily as they,</p>
      <p>Although his home is very far away.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>He chirps of lanes, of far-off country places</p>
      <p class="i2">(This is the sparrows' story that I'm telling);</p>
      <p>Long, long ago they lived in sweet wide spaces;</p>
      <p class="i2">Their homes were in the hedges, gay, green-smelling;</p>
      <p>The people, though, came citywards to dwell;</p>
      <p>"Then we," the sparrows said, "must go as well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Yes, we're the birds to go, for all our brothers</p>
      <p class="i2">Would lose their songs in cities dark and crowdy;</p>
      <p>Their hearts would break; but we're not like the others,</p>
      <p class="i2">We cannot sing, our coats are drab and dowdy;</p>
      <p>But we can chirp and chirp and chirp again;</p>
      <p>The people shan't forget a country lane."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>And so they came, and in all city-weathers</p>
      <p class="i2">They chirped a note of cheer to exiles weary;</p>
      <p>And <i>still</i> the sparrows chirp, for their brown feathers</p>
      <p class="i2">Hide now, as then, brave kindly hearts and cheery,</p>
      <p>Of lanes they've never seen nor lived among,</p>
      <p>Of country lanes they sing, the same old song.</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p><i>The Romance of Madame Tussaud's</i> (<font
  class="sc">Odhams</font>) strikes one, in these days of universal
  reminiscence, almost as a <i>libre à faire</i>, certainly as a volume
  that finds its welcome waiting for it. I suppose there are few unhappy
  beings for whom the very name of that gifted lady does not revive
  something of the nursery magic that is never quite forgotten. All of
  which means that Mr. <font class="sc">John T. Tussaud</font>, who has
  written, vivaciously and with obvious pleasure, this history of the
  famous show, is (I hope) assured beforehand of his sales. It is a fat
  record, taking the story from the earliest wax profiles made by Dr. <font
  class="sc">Curtius</font> for the Parisian aristocracy in the days before
  the Revolution; through the Terror, when his niece (afterwards Madame
  <font class="sc">Tussaud</font>) was employed to model notable heads from
  the basket of the guillotine, which was itself subsequently to figure
  amongst the attractions of her collection, and finally bringing the
  enterprising artist and her models to England and Baker Street, whence a
  comparatively recent move established them (the foundress in effigy only)
  in their present palace. I was especially interested to trace the
  evidence of close attention paid to the show by Mr. Punch, and in
  particular to learn that the title Chamber of Horrors was first invented
  by that observer; though the author falls into an obvious chronological
  inexactitude in ascribing to these pages a cartoon by <font
  class="sc">Cruikshank</font> published "in November of Waterloo year." I
  have no space for the many queer stories, chiefly of encounters between
  the quick and the wax, with which the book abounds, nor for more than
  mention of its admirable photographs, of which I should have liked many
  more. Altogether it gives an unusual sidelight on the history of two
  Capitals; and incidentally, if the reading of it puts others in the same
  resolve as myself, an extra turn-stile will be needed in the Marylebone
  Road.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Harry Tighe</font> is something of a problem to
  me. With the best will in the world to appreciate what looked like
  unusual promise I can only regard him at present as one who is neglecting
  the good gifts of heaven in the pursuit apparently of some
  Jack-o'-lanthorn idea of popularity. No doubt you recall his first novel,
  <i>The Sheep Path</i>, a sincere and well-observed study of feminine
  temperament. This was followed by one that (though it had its friends)
  marked, to my thinking, a lamentable fall from grace. He has now
  published a third, <i>Day Dawn</i> (<font class="sc">Westall</font>).
  Here, though popularity of a kind may be its reward, the work is still
  woefully beneath what should be Mr. <font class="sc">Tighe's</font>
  level. Certainly not one of the demands of the circulating libraries is
  unfulfilled. We have a fair-haired heroine (victim to cocaine), a dark
  and villainous foreigner, a dashing hero, a middle-aged woman who adores
  him despite the presence of her husband, himself called throughout
  <i>Baron Brinthall</i>, a style surely more common in pantomimic circles
  than in the drawing-rooms of Mayfair; and the incidents embrace both
  murder and suicide. Moreover there is "plenty of conversation," and the
  intrigue moves sufficiently quickly (if jerkily) to keep one curious
  about the next page. But having very willingly admitted so much I return
  to my contention, that for Mr. <font class="sc">Tighe</font> to neglect
  his sensitive and delicate art for the antics of these <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span> tawdry
  dolls is to betray both himself and the craft of which he may still
  become a distinguished exponent.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>From the official who is interested in officialdom to the Infantry
  officer who is interested in tactics, from the mechanical expert who can
  appreciate the technical details of diagrams to the child who revels in
  faultless photographs of hair-raising monsters ("I may read it, mother,
  mayn't I, when I've unstickied my fingers?" was the way I heard it put),
  everybody, I think, will find plenty to attract him in Sir <font
  class="sc">Albert Stern's</font> finely illustrated <i>Tanks
  1914-1918</i> (<font class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</font>). Tanks were
  born at Lincoln, and rightly so, for did not <font class="sc">Oliver
  Cromwell's</font> Ironsides mostly come from this region?&mdash;and the
  main theme of this book is to show how much more formidable an obstacle
  they found in the files and registries of Whitehall than in the trenches
  and wire-entanglements of Flanders and France. Parents they had and
  sponsors innumerable. Practical soldiers and engineers were enthusiastic
  about them, and the Bosch quaked in his trenches or ran; but even so late
  as the autumn of 1917, after General <font class="sc">Foch</font> (as he
  was then) had said, "You must make quantities and quantities; we must
  fight mechanically," one stout little company of obscurantists bravely
  defied the creed of Juggernaut until the irresistible logic of its
  successes in the field crushed them remorselessly under the "creeping
  grip." And that company, of course, according to Sir <font
  class="sc">Albert Stern</font>, was the British War Office.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Let me commend to you <i>The Mask</i> (<font
  class="sc">Methuen</font>) as a craftsmanlike essay in imaginative
  realism; ruthlessly candid and self-revealing, but free from that
  tiresome obsession of the ultra-realists that everything that has ever
  happened is equally important in retrospect. The narrator, <i>Vanya
  Gombarov</i>, a Russian Jew, discourses reflectively and detachedly, as
  it were from behind a mask, to an English artist friend about his early
  childhood in his own land and the dismal adventures of the
  <i>Gombarov</i> family in that underworld of exploited and miserable
  aliens which is one of the root social problems of America. Very
  poignantly Mr. <font class="sc">John Cournos</font> makes you understand
  the import of the phrase so constantly on the lips of such victims of
  their own credulous hopes of El Dorado&mdash;"Woe to <font
  class="sc">Columbus</font>!" The portrait of <i>Vanya's</i> stepfather,
  brilliant, magnanimous, pursued by an Æschylean malignity of destiny,
  fills much of the foreground and is a quite masterly piece of work. One
  cannot be wrong in assuming this to be essential autobiography; there is
  a passionate conviction as of things intimately seen and dreadfully
  suffered. Such material might well have tempted to a mere piling of
  squalor upon squalor. A fine discretion has given a noble dignity to a
  record through which shines the unquenchable human spirit. One passage,
  full of affectionate discernment about London, will cause a flicker of
  just pride in everyone who is authentic Cockney, whether by birth or
  adoption. A big book of its kind, I dare assert.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>Star of India</i> (<font class="sc">Cassell</font>) is what Mrs.
  <font class="sc">Alice Perrin</font> calls her latest novel, a title so
  good that I can only wonder why (or perhaps whether) it has not been used
  before. Inside also I found excellent entertainment. One supposes the
  author to have been confronted with two main problems with regard to her
  plot&mdash;how to make sufficiently plausible the marriage between a
  flapper (if you will forgive the odious word) of seventeen and a
  middle-ageing Anglo-Indian; and, secondly, how to impart any touch of
  novelty to the inevitable catastrophe that must attend this union. The
  first she has managed by a very cunning suggestion of the mingled
  jealousy, curiosity and boredom that drove <i>Stella</i> into the arms of
  her elderly suitor; the second by a variety of devices, to indicate which
  would be to give away the whole intrigue&mdash;one, I may say, whose
  climax is not nearly so visible from afar as that of most triangle tales.
  One point only I will reveal: Mrs. <font class="sc">Perrin</font> has had
  the courage, while vindicating her own common-sense judgment upon such
  folk, to introduce a second girl, daughter and pupil of one of the
  spoon-fed idealists who would govern India with the platitudes of
  ignorance, and not only to make her sympathetic, but to convince me of
  her attractions, which (especially just now) was not easy work. Decidedly
  a first-rate yarn.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We may, I think, take it that the love-story in <i>The Gunroom</i>
  (<font class="sc">Black</font>) is fiction pure and naively simple, but
  that the experiences of <i>John Lynwood</i>, the hero, in the Navy are
  given as the actual experiences of Mr. <font class="sc">C.L.
  Morgan</font>, the author. Let me then at once say that his revelations
  of the bullying of junior by senior midshipmen go back to a period before
  the War. These "shakings," we are asked to believe, were due partly to
  custom and partly to boredom caused by lack of leave. If Mr. <font
  class="sc">Morgan</font> is correct both in his facts and surmises it is
  satisfactory to think that the War must have obliterated the boredom
  which provoked such excesses, and one need not be a fanatical opponent of
  physical punishment to hope that such forms of tyranny will never again
  be tolerated as a matter of custom. I am obliged to conclude that these
  incidents in <i>Lynwood's</i> career are absolutely true, for certainly
  nothing less than absolute truth could excuse their appearance in print;
  but at the same time I must confess that any attack upon our Navy is apt
  with me to act as an irritant. The more reason that I should honestly
  admit Mr. <font class="sc">Morgan's</font> merits and say that he writes
  with a nice sense of style, and that his book does not derive its only
  interest from its revelations.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
